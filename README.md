# 🧮 Calculator – Python 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **command-line calculator application** developed using Python.

The calculator supports:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Continuous calculations
* Restart functionality

The program is designed using **function mapping and modular logic**, allowing operations to be selected dynamically at runtime.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built this project to practice:

* Function design
* Dictionary-based function mapping
* Loop control
* Recursive restart logic
* Handling edge cases like division by zero

Instead of writing one long script, this project separates operations into reusable functions and uses a dictionary to dynamically select operations, improving scalability and readability.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* Function definitions
* Dictionaries mapping symbols to functions
* Loops (`while`)
* Conditional branching
* Recursion (restart logic)
* Floating-point arithmetic
* User input handling

* Arithmetic function definitions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`)
* Operation dictionary mapping symbols to functions
* Main calculator loop
* Restart logic implementation 

### 🔹 `art.py`

Contains:

* ASCII logo displayed at startup

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-cli-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-cli-calculator
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user inputs the first number.
2. The program displays available operations.
3. The user selects an operation.
4. The second number is entered.
5. The program calculates the result.
6. The user can:

   * Continue with the result
   * Start a new calculation
   * Exit the program

Division by zero is handled safely.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Dynamic function execution using dictionaries
* Modular arithmetic logic
* Building interactive command-line tools
* Structuring small programs cleanly
* Writing reusable and extendable code

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add input validation for invalid operations
* Improve error handling
* Add exponent and modulo operations
* Convert into a GUI version
* Build a scientific calculator version
* Implement logging functionality
